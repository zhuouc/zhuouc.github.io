AMOC fingerprint
------
Proposed the first remote fingerprint of historical AMOC change outside the North Atlantic, providing new evidence for the anthropogenic weakening of AMOC.
This study is also widely mentioned in news and blogs, such as [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/02/climate/atlantic-ocean-climate-change.html) and [RealClimate](https://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2020/09/new-studies-confirm-weakening-of-the-gulf-stream-circulation-amoc/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=new-studies-confirm-weakening-of-the-gulf-stream-circulation-amoc).

Deglacial AMOC evolution
------
* Participated in the worldâ€™s first climate-isotope transient simulation experiment[(iTRACE)](https://www.earthsystemgrid.org/dataset/ucar.cgd.ccsm4.iTRACE.html)since the last glacial maximum (LGM), especially contributing to the simulations forced by earth orbital configuration and continental ice sheets. 
* Detected the competition effect between greenhouse gases and continental ice sheets on glacial AMOC, providing a possible mechanism for the uncertainty of glacial AMOC intensity in both reconstructions and model simulations.

AAIW and AMOC stability
------
Found that there is common bias in the Antarctic intermediate water (AAIW) in climate models, providing new ideas for improving the stability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in the model.
